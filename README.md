## About me

I am a dedicated and persistent individual, who possesses ability to work with people and with devices. I am organized and detail oriented with analytical mindset. And due to my personality, I pursue high communication, empathy and kindness skills, which all are helpful in approaching people and solving their problems.

I got my Master's Degree from the University of Ukraine. However, my major is called Tourism, we processed a lot of math, statistics, research, business and economics. But, in general, I am a typical "switcher", as you may have heard about people, who decided after graduation to move to another field and through self-education, trainings, courses, they started new career. 

Now, I am exploiting my research and analytical skills in software testing. Currently, I have finished my previous project as a QA manual for an automotive manufacturer, where I tested Android apps and systems. Currently, I am involved in volunteering as a Manual QA at a startup, where I continue to use my gained experience and, of course, continue to learn new tools, methodologies and technologies. Overall I have 7 years within IT industry, working with internal and external clients, resolving issues and reducing time spent on different operations tasks for top management, fascilitatings meetings, performing knowledge transfers to junior employees, leading a small team of 8 projects management assistants, coordinating projects within large international tech company, assuring to follow Agile framework. While having my freelance longtime project as a compliance analyst, working for the USA company, I saw results of my work, I helped with team communication and managing, solved issues with remediation workflow, assuring that quality assurance and quality control methods and tools work perfectly.

I would be extremely happy to continue applying my obtained knowledge in testing. It is a crucial step in my current career goal — to become a senior-level software tester in 2 years.
